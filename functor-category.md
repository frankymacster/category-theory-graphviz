a functor category {\displaystyle D^{C}}{\displaystyle D^{C}} is a category where the objects are the functors {\displaystyle F:C\to D}F:C\to D and the morphisms are natural transformations {\displaystyle \eta :F\to G}\eta: F \to G between the functors

Functor categories are of interest for two main reasons:
  many commonly occurring categories are (disguised) functor categories, so any statement proved for general functor categories is widely applicable;

  every category embeds in a functor category (via the Yoneda embedding); the functor category often has nicer properties than the original category, allowing certain operations that were not available in the original setting.
