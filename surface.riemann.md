A Riemann surface X
 is a connected complex manifold of complex dimension one.
  This means that X is a connected Hausdorff space
   that is endowed with an atlas of charts
    to the open unit disk of the complex plane:
     for every point x ∈ X
      there is a neighbourhood of x
       that is homeomorphic to the open unit disk of the complex plane,
        and the transition maps between two overlapping charts
         are required to be holomorphic.
A Riemann surface
 is an oriented manifold of (real) dimension two
  – a two-sided surface –
   together with a conformal structure.
    Again,
     manifold means that locally at any point x of X,
      the space is homeomorphic to a subset of the real plane.
       The supplement "Riemann"
        signifies that X is endowed with an additional structure
         which allows angle measurement on the manifold,
          namely an equivalence class of so-called Riemannian metrics.
           Two such metrics are considered equivalent
            if the angles they measure are the same.
             Choosing an equivalence class of metrics on X
              is the additional datum of the conformal structure.
