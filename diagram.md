```
Formally,
  a diagram of type J in a category C
    is a (covariant) functor
      D : J â†’ C.
```

```
The category J
  is called the index category
  or the scheme of the diagram D;
the functor
  is sometimes called a J-shaped diagram
```

### Category level

```graphviz
digraph G {
  "Index" [shape="square"]
  "C" [shape="square"]

  "Index" -> "C" [label="Diagram"]
}
```
