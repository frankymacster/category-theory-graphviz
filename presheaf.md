Let X be a topological space,
 and let C be a category
  A presheaf F on X
   is a functor with values in C
    given by the following data:
      For each open set U of X,
       there corresponds an object F(U) in C
      For each inclusion of open sets V âŠ† U,
       there corresponds a morphism res_{V,U} : F(U) -> F(V) in the category C
